    <h1>Assignment 12 - SQL Exercises and HTML Application</h1>

    <p>This page includes example SQL statements from W3Schools and applies foundational HTML skills.</p>

    <h2>SQL Activity Examples</h2>

    <p><strong>1. SQL SELECT Statement</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers;</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>2. SQL WHERE Clause (filtered to USA)</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Country = 'USA';</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>3. SQL COUNT Function</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT COUNT(CustomerID) FROM Customers;</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>4. SQL INSERT INTO Statement</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country)<br>
        VALUES ('Cardinal', 'Tom B. Erichsen', 'Skagen 21', 'Stavanger', '4006', 'Norway');</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>5. SQL UPDATE Statement</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>UPDATE Customers SET ContactName = 'Alfred Schmidt', City = 'Frankfurt'<br>
        WHERE CustomerID = 1;</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Learning Summary</h2>
    <p>
        Completing this assignment helped me understand how SQL statements interact with databases. I learned how to use
        SELECT, WHERE, COUNT, INSERT INTO, and UPDATE commands effectively. Executing them on W3Schools reinforced my
        confidence in querying and modifying data. Additionally, writing and organizing HTML strengthened my knowledge
        of semantic tags and page layout. The inclusion of an external CSS file showed how styling can be separated from
        structure, which improves maintainability. These skills are directly applicable in both web development and data
        management environments, and I feel more prepared to build dynamic, data-driven websites.
